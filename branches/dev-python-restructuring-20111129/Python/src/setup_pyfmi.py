LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
PyFMI is a package for loading and interacting with Functional Mock-Up 
Units (FMUs), which are compiled dynamic models compliant with the 
Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI), see 
http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/ for more information.

FMI is a standard that enables tool independent exchange of dynamic 
models on binary format. Several industrial simulation platforms 
supports export of FMUs, including, Dymola, JModelica.org, OpenModelica 
and SimulationX, see http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/tools 
for a complete list. PyFMI offers a Python interface for interacting 
with FMUs and enables for example loading of FMU models, setting of 
model parameters and evaluation of model equations.

PyFMI is available as a stand-alone package or as part of the 
JModelica.org distribution. Using PyFMI together with the Python 
simulation package Assimulo adds industrial grade simulation 
capabilities of FMUs to Python.
