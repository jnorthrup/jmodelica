$section The CppAD Wish List$$
$index wish list$$
$index new, features$$
$index features, new$$

$head Atan2$$
$index atan2$$
The $xref/Atan2//atan2/$$ function could be made faster by adding
a special operator for it.

$head BenderQuad$$
See the $cref/problem/BenderQuad/Problem/$$ with the 
current $code BenderQuad$$ specifications.

$head CondExp$$
$index CondExp$$
Extend the conditional expressions $xref/CondExp/$$ so that they are 
valid for complex types by comparing real parts.
In addition, use this change to extend $xref/LuRatio/$$ so 
that it works with complex AD types.

$head Ipopt$$
$list number$$
The vector of sets $cref/sparsity pattern/glossary/Sparsity Pattern/$$
could be compared for speed with of vector of bools
(and used instead if it is faster).

$lnext
Perhaps it would help to cache the solution of the sparse Jacobian
and spare Hessian graph coloring algorithm.
Then, when the sparsity pattern does not depend on the argument value,
these colorings would not have to be recomputed.

$lnext
In the case where $codei%retape(%k%)%$$ is true for some $icode k$$,
one can still use the structure of the representation to compute a 
sparsity structure. Currently $code cppad_ipopt_nlp$$ uses a dense 
sparsity structure for this case

$lnext
The $icode new_x$$ flag could be used to avoid zero order forward mode
computations. Because the same $code ADFun$$ object is used at different
argument values, this would require forward mode at multiple argument values
(see $cref/multiple arguments/WishList/Multiple Arguments/$$). 

$lend

$head Library$$
One could build a CppAD library for use with the type $code AD<double>$$.
This would speed up compilation for the most common usage where
the $italic Base$$ type is $code double$$.


$head Multiple Arguments$$
It has been suggested that computing and storing forward mode
results for multiple argument values (and for multiple orders)
is faster for Adolc. 
Perhaps CppAD should allow for forward mode at multiple argument values
(perhaps multiple orders).

$head Numeric Limits$$
Use a multiple of $code std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon()$$ instead
$code 1e-10$$ for a small number in correctness checks; e.g.,
see $cref/tan.cpp/$$.

$head Operation Sequence$$
$index sequence, operation$$
$index operation, sequence$$
It is possible to detect if the 
AD of $italic Base$$ 
$xref/glossary/Operation/Sequence/operation sequence/1/$$ 
does not depend on any of the
$cref/independent variable/glossary/Tape/Independent Variable/$$ values.
This could be returned as an extra
$xref/seq_property/$$.

$head Optimization$$

$subhead Expression Hashing$$
During expression sequence $cref/optimization/optimize/$$,
hash codes are used to detect expressions that have already
been computed.
Perhaps this should be done during the original forward mode recording. 

$subhead Microsoft Compiler$$
The Microsoft's Visual C++ Version 9.0 generates a warning of the form
$codei warning C4396:%...%$$ 
for every template function that is declared as a both a friend and inline
(it thinks it is only doing this for specializations of template functions).
The $code CPPAD_INLINE$$ preprocessor symbol is used to convert
these $code inline$$ directives to
empty code (if a Microsoft Visual C++ is used).
If it is shown to be faster and does not slow down CppAD with other compilers,
non-friend functions should be used to map these operations
to member functions so that both can be compiled inline.

$head Software Guidelines$$

$subhead Boost$$
The following is a list of some software guidelines taken from
$href%http://www.boost.org/more/lib_guide.htm#Guidelines%boost%$$.
These guidelines are not followed by the current CppAD source code,
but perhaps they should be:

$list number$$
Names (except as noted below) 
should be all lowercase, with words separated by underscores.
For example, acronyms should be treated as ordinary names 
(xml_parser instead of XML_parser).

$lnext
Template parameter names should begin with an uppercase letter.

$lnext
Use spaces rather than tabs.  

$lend

$head Sparsity Patterns$$
When using arrays of booleans for
$cref/sparsity patterns/glossary/Sparsity Pattern/$$, 
use OpenMP to parallelize the computation of the sparsity patterns.


$head Speed Testing$$
Extend the speed tests for Adolc, Fadbad, and Sacado
to run under MS Windows.
Run the CppAD $cref/speed/$$ tests on a set of different machines
and operating systems.

$head Tan and Tanh$$
The AD $code tan$$ and $code tanh$$ functions
are implemented using the AD $code sin$$, $code cos$$, $code sinh$$
and $code cosh$$ functions.
They could be improved by making them atomic using the equations
$latex \[
\begin{array}{rcl}
	\tan^{(1)} (x)  & = & 1 + \tan (x)^2 \\
	\tanh^{(1)} (x) & = & 1 - \tanh (x)^2
\end{array}
\] $$
see $cref/standard math functions/ForwardTheory/Standard Math Functions/$$.

$head Tracing$$
Add operation sequence tracing to the user API and documentation.

$head VecAD$$
Make assignment operation in $cref/VecAD/$$ like
assignment in $cref/ad_copy/$$.
This will fix slicing to $code int$$ when assigning
from $code double$$ to 
$code VecAD< AD<double> >::reference$$ object.

$head Vector Element Type$$
Change cross references from 
$xref/SimpleVector/Elements of Specified Type/elements of a specified type/$$
to
$xref/SimpleVector/Value Type/value_type/$$.
