$section ADFun Object Deprecated Member Functions$$

$head Syntax$$
$icode%f%.Dependent(%y%)
%$$
$icode%o% = %f%.Order()
%$$
$icode%m% = %f%.Memory()
%$$
$icode%s% = %f%.Size()
%$$
$icode%t% = %f%.taylor_size()
%$$
$icode%u% = %f%.use_VecAD()
%$$


$head Purpose$$
The $codei%ADFun<%Base%>%$$ functions documented here have been deprecated;
i.e., they are no longer approved of and may be removed from some future
version of CppAD.

$head Dependent$$
$index ADFun, Dependent$$
$index Dependent, ADFun$$
A recording of and AD of $icode Base$$
$xref/glossary/Operation/Sequence/operation sequence/1/$$
is started by a call of the form
$codei%
	Independent(%x%)
%$$ 
If there is only one such recording at the current time,
you can use $icode%f%.Dependent(%y%)%$$ in place of
$codei%
	%f%.Dependent(%x%, %y%)
%$$
See $cref/Dependent/$$ for a description of this operation.

$subhead Deprecated$$
This syntax was deprecated when CppAD was extended to allow
for more than one $codei%AD<%Base%>%$$ recording to be
active at one time. 
This was necessary to allow for multiple threading applications.

$head Order$$
$index ADFun, Order$$
$index Order, ADFun$$
The result $icode o$$ has prototype 
$codei%
	size_t %o%
%$$
and is the order of the previous forward operation
using the function $icode f$$.
This is the highest order of the 
$xref/glossary/Taylor Coefficient/Taylor coefficients/$$
that are currently stored in $icode f$$.

$subhead Deprecated$$
Zero order corresponds to function values being stored in $icode f$$.
In the future, we would like to be able to erase the function
values so that $icode f$$ uses less memory. 
In this case, the return value of $code Order$$ would not make sense.
Use $xref/size_taylor/$$ to obtain 
the number of Taylor coefficients currently stored
in the ADFun object $icode f$$ 
(which is equal to the order plus one).


$head Memory$$
$index ADFun, Memory$$
$index Memory, ADFun$$
The result 
$codei%
	size_t %m%
%$$
and is the number of memory units ($code sizeof$$) required for the
information currently stored in $icode f$$.
This memory is returned to the system when the destructor for 
$icode f$$ is called.

$subhead Deprecated$$
It used to be the case that an ADFun object just kept increasing its
buffers to the maximum size necessary during its lifetime.
It would then return the buffers to the system when its destructor
was called.
This is no longer the case, an ADFun object now returns memory
when it no longer needs the values stored in that memory.
Thus the $code Memory$$ function is no longer well defined.

$head Size$$
$index ADFun, Size$$
$index Size, ADFun$$
The result $icode s$$ has prototype
$codei%
	size_t %s%
%$$
and is the number of variables in the operation sequence plus the following:
one for a phantom variable with tape address zero,
one for each component of the domain that is a parameter.
The amount of work and memory necessary for computing function values
and derivatives using $icode f$$ is roughly proportional to $italic s$$.

$subhead Deprecated$$
There are other sizes attached to an ADFun object, for example,
the number of operations in the sequence.
In order to avoid confusion with these other sizes,
use $xref/seq_property/size_var/size_var/$$ to obtain 
the number of variables in the operation sequence.

$head taylor_size$$
$index ADFun, taylor_size$$
$index taylor_size, ADFun$$
The result $icode t$$ has prototype
$codei%
	size_t %t%
%$$
and is the number of Taylor coefficients, 
per variable in the AD operation sequence,
currently calculated and stored in the ADFun object $icode f$$.

$subhead Deprecated$$
For the purpose of uniform naming,
this function has been replaced by $xref/size_taylor/$$.

$head use_VecAD$$
$index ADFun, use_VecAD$$
$index use_VecAD, ADFun$$
The result $icode u$$ has prototype
$codei%
	bool %u%
%$$
If it is true, the
AD of $icode Base$$
$xref/glossary/Operation/Sequence/operation sequence/1/$$
stored in $icode f$$ contains 
$xref/VecAD/VecAD<Base>::reference/$$ operands.
Otherwise $icode u$$ is false.

$subhead Deprecated$$
You can instead use
$codei%
	%u% = %f%.size_VecAD() > 0
%$$
