<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Version 3.0 is <b>not</b> backward compatible to previous
versions. A conversion script is provided to transform models and
libraries of previous versions to the new version. Therefore,
conversion should be automatic.</p>
<p>The following changes are present for the whole library:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Modelica language version 3.0, several restrictions have
been introduced to allow better checking, e.g., models on all
levels must be balanced (number of equations = number of unknown
variables - unknown variables that have to be defined when using
the component). A few models of the Modelica Standard Library did
not fulfill these new restrictions and had either to be moved to
library ObsoleteModelica3 (e.g., Blocks.Math.TwoInputs) or had to
be differently implemented (e.g.,
Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium.BaseProperties). The Modelica
Standard Library version 3.0 fulfills all the restrictions of the
Modelica Language version 3.0.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>The graphical annotations describing the layout of icon and
diagram layer are changed from Modelica language version 1 to
Modelica language version 3. This gives several significant
improvements:<br />
Especially, the coordinate systems of icon and diagram layers are
no longer coupled and therefore the size of the icon layer can be
changed independently of the size of the diagram layer. Also it can
be defined that the aspect ratio of a component icon is kept when
changing its size in a model. This flag is set so that all icons of
the Modelica Standard Library keep its aspect ratios. This is
slightly non-backward compatible: If the aspect ratio was not kept
when using a component from the Modelica Standard Library, it is
now resized so that the aspect ratio is maintained.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>All non-standard annotations removed by:<br />
(1) Removing the annotation since without effect (e.g.,
"__Dymola_experimentSetupOutput", "Window", "Terminal"
removed).<br />
(2) Renaming the annotation to a standard name (e.g., "Hide"
renamed to "HideResult").<br />
(3) Renaming the annotation to a vendor specific name (e.g.,
"checkBox" renamed to "__Dymola_checkBox").<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>All emulated enumerations (defined via packages and constants)
have been replaced by "real" enumerations. User models are
automatically correctly converted, provided the user models used
the package constants previously. <b>Existing models that use
directly literal values for enumerations, might give in some cases
wrong results</b> (if the first constant of the emulated
enumeration had value zero, whereas the first value of an
enumeration is one).<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>The operator "cardinality" will be removed in one of the next
versions of the Modelica language, since it is a reflective
operator and its usage significantly reduces the possibilities of
advanced model checks (e.g., to guarantee that a model is
"balanced", i.e., the number of equations and unknowns is
identical, for all valid usages of the component). As a preparation
for this change, all models that contain the "cardinality(..)"
operator are rewritten: If possible the operator is removed. If
this is not possible, it is only used in asserts to check that,
e.g., a connector is connected at least once or is connected
exactly once. In the next Modelica language version new language
elements will be introduced to specify such a property check
without the cardinality operator. Once these language elements are
available, the cardinality operator will be removed completely from
the Modelica Standard Library.<br />
The changes with respect to the cardinality(..) operator are
usually not backward compatible. This is the reason for the changes
of the Rotational and Translational library (see below).<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>The design of the <b>Rotational</b> and <b>Translational</b>
libraries have been changed (especially to remove the
cardinality(..) operator, see above):
<ul>
<li>Components have a <b>useSupport</b> flag to enable or disable a
support flange. If the support flange is enabled, it must be
connected. If it is disabled, it must not be connected and the
component is then internally grounded. The grounding is visualized
in the icon.</li>
<li>The relative angle/distance and the relative speed of all
force/torque elements (that need the relative speed) are by default
defined with "StateSelect.prefer", i.e., to use these variables as
preferred states. This improves the numerics if the absolute angle
or the absolute distance are continuously increasing during
operation (e.g., driving shaft of the wheels of a car). The effect
is that relative angles/distances and speeds are used as states and
the size of these variables is limited. Previously, the default was
to use the absolute angle/distance and absolute speed of every
inertia/mass which has the disadvantage that the absolute angle and
or distance are state variables that grow in size
continuously.<br />
A significant advantage is also, that default initialization is
usually better, because a default value of zero for a relative
angle/distance is usually what the user would like to have.
Previously, say, the load was initialized to a non-zero angle and
then the elastically coupled motor inertia had to be explicitly
also initialized with this value. This is now, no longer needed.
Since the default nominal value of 1 is usually too large for a
relative quantity, the nominal values of the relative
angle/distance was changed to 1e-4.</li>
<li>The two libraries have been restructured in sublibraries to
cope with the growing number of components.</li>
<li>Finally, the Translational library has been made as similar as
possible to the Rotational library by, e.g., adding missing
components.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The initialization of the MultiBody, Rotational and
Translational libraries have been significantly simplified by
removing the "initType" parameters and only using start/fixed
values. This design assumes that a tool has special support for
start/fixed values in the parameter menu.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Nearly all parameters defined in the Modelica Standard Library
had been defined with a default equation, e.g.,
<pre>
   <b>parameter</b> Modelica.SIunits.Resistance R=1; 
</pre>
Physical parameters, such as a resistance, mass, gear ratio, do not
have a meaningful default and in nearly all cases, the user of the
corresponding component has to provide values for such parameters.
If the user forgets this, a tool cannot provide diagnostics, since
a default value is present in the library (such as 1 Ohm for the
resistance). In most cases the model will simulate but will give
wrong results due to wrong parameter values. To improve this
situation, all physical parameter declarations in the Modelica
Standard Library have been changed, so that the previous default
becomes a start value. For example, the above declaration is
changed to:
<pre>
   <b>parameter</b> Modelica.SIunits.Resistance R(start=1);  
</pre>
This is a backward compatible change and completely equivalent from
the perspective of the Modelica language. It is, however, advised
that tools will print a warning or optionally an error message, if
the start value of a parameter is defined, but no value for the
parameter is given via a modification. Furthermore, it is expected,
that the input field of a parameter menu is empty, if no default
equation is defined, but only a start value. This shows clearly to
the modeler that a value has to be provided.</li>
</ul>

written by limiting the damping torque in such a case so that
"pulling" torques can no longer occur. Furthermore, during
initialization the characteristics is made continuous to reduce
numerical errors. The relative angle and relative angular
velocities are used as states, if possible (StateSelect.prefer),
since relative quantities lead usually to better behavior.</td>

w.start. The conversion script performs the necessary conversion of
existing models automatically.</td>
