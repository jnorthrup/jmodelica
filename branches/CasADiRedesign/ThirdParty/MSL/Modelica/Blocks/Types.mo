This initialization type is identical to Types.Init and has just one
additional option <b>DoNotUse_InitialIntegratorState</b>. This option
is introduced in order that the default initialization for the
Continuous.PID and Continuous.LimPID blocks are backward
compatible. In Modelica 2.2, the integrators have been initialized
with their given states where as the D-part has not been initialized.
The option \"DoNotUse_InitialIntegratorState\" leads to this
initialization definition.
