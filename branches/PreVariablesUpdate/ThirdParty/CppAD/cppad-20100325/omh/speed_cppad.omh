$section Speed Test Derivatives Using CppAD$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to determine if 
certain changes improve its execution speed
(and to compare CppAD with other AD packages).
This section links to the source code the CppAD speed tests
(any suggestions to make the CppAD results faster are welcome).


$head Speed$$
To run these tests, you must include the
$code --with-Speed$$ command line option during the
$cref/install configure/InstallUnix/Configure/$$ command. 
After the $cref/make test/InstallUnix/make test/$$ command
has been execute in the $code speed/cppad$$ directory, 
you can then run the CppAD speed tests 
with the following commands (relative to the distribution directory):
$syntax%
	speed/cppad/cppad correct %seed%
%$$
where $italic seed$$ is a positive integer see for the
random number generator $cref/uniform_01/$$.
This will check that the speed tests have been built correctly.
You can run the command
$syntax%
	speed/cppad/cppad speed %seed%
%$$
to see the results of all the speed tests.
See $cref/speed_main/$$ for more options.

$head C++ Compiler Flags$$
The C++ compiler flags used to build the CppAD speed tests are
$code
$verbatim%speed/cppad/makefile.am%5%# BEGIN OPTIMIZE%# END OPTIMIZE%$$
$$
where $code CXX_FLAGS$$ is specified by the 
$cref/configure/InstallUnix/Configure/$$ command.
