IDAS is a package for the solution of differential-algebraic equation (DAE) 
systems with sensitivity analysis capabilities (both forward and adjoint modes). 
It is written in ANSI standard C.

IDAS can be used both on serial and parallel (MPI) computers.  The main
difference is in the NVECTOR module of vector kernels.  The desired
version is obtained when compiling the example files by linking the
appropriate library of NVECTOR kernels.  In the parallel version,
communication between processors is done with the MPI (Message Passage
Interface) system.

When used with the serial NVECTOR module, IDAS provides both direct 
(dense and band) linear solvers and preconditioned Krylov (iterative) 
linear solvers. Three different iterative solvers are available: scaled 
preconditioned GMRES (SPGMR), scaled preconditioned BiCGStab (SPBCG), and 
scaled preconditioned TFQMR (SPTFQMR). When IDAS is used with the parallel 
NVECTOR module, only the Krylov linear solvers are available.  For the 
latter case, in addition to the basic solver, the IDA package also contains 
a preconditioner module called IDABBDPRE, which provides a band-block-diagonal 
preconditioner.

IDAS is part of a software family called SUNDIALS: SUite of Nonlinear and 
DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers [3].  This suite consists of CVODE, 
CVODES, IDA, IDAS, and KINSOL.  The directory structure of the package supplied 
reflects this family relationship.

Several examples problem programs are included, covering both serial
and parallel cases, both small and large problem sizes, and both
linear and nonlinear problems.

The notes below provide the location of documentation, directions for the 
installation of the IDAS package, and relevant references. Following that 
is a brief history of revisions to the package.
