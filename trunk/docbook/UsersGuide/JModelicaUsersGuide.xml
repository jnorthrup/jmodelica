      <title>About JModelica.org</title>

      <para>JModelica.org is an extensible Modelica-based open source platform
      for optimization, simulation and analysis of complex dynamic systems.
      The main objective of the project is to create an industrially viable
      open source platform for optimization of Modelica models, while offering
      a flexible platform serving as a virtual lab for algorithm development
      and research. As such, JModelica.org is intended to provide a platform
      for technology transfer where industrially relevant problems can inspire
      new research and where state of the art algorithms can be propagated
      form academia into industrial use. JModelica.org is a result of research
      at the Department of Automatic Control, Lund University, and is now
      maintained and developed by Modelon AB.</para>
