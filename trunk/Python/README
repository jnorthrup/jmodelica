JMODELICA PYTHON INTERFACE
===================
The JModelica Python Interface (JMPI) enables you to work with both Modelica and 
Optimica models in Python. As Python is an interpreted language you can work 
interactively or using scripts.

HOW TO USE
===================
1. Add the folder containing the jmodelica package to your PYTHONPATH.
2. Add the environment variable JMODELICA_HOME which should point at your 
JModelica installation root folder.
3. Import the JMPI by adding

     import jmodelica
    
   to your Python source code.

RUNNING TESTS
===================
The JMI tests requires the Nose Python testing framework that can be
downloaded from:

  http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/
  
(should also be included in most Linux distros as "python-nose")

Run the tests in the tests package with

	nosetests -a stddist
	
standing in the 'tests' directory in the jmodelica package. Nose then finds all
available tests that are related to the standard JModelica.org bundle and runs
them. For details on how to run specific tests, and more, have a look at the
Nose website and 'man nosetests'.

If you don't add the '-a stddist' flag packages that are not part of the
official requirements for JModelica.org might be loaded for tests. This might
result in import errors if your system does not contain those packages.

RUNNING EXAMPLES
===================
There are a number of example models in the examples package which 
demonstrate how the JModelica Python Interface can be used. In all 
examples packages there is one .mo file for the Modelica and Optimica 
code, describing the model and optimization problem, and one demo.py file 
which shows the Python code needed to compile, run the model and solve 
an optimization problem. Take a look at the code or simply run an 
example with 

	import demo
	demo.run_demo()

RUNNING TESTS - FAQ
===================
If the test fails and outputs something similar to

  JMIException: libipopt.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such
  file or directory
  
you are missing the Ipopt shared library in your library path. This can
be solved in two ways:

 1) By installing Ipopt on your system (so that library ends up in
    /usr/local/lib or similar). See Ipopt documentation for this.
    
 2) By setting an environment variable in your shell by invoking
 
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/ipopt_build/lib
      
    Unless you put this in your shell's resource file (for example
    ~/.bashrc) you will need to run this command every time you open up
    a new shell.
    
CODING GUIDELINES
===================
The Python coding standards used are trying to adhere to Python Coding
Guidelines found in PEP8[1] <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/> 
with the exception of using UTF-8 encoding and NOT latin-1. Here is a summary:

 * Indent using _spaces_ of width 4.
 * Class names should begin with uppercase and use CamelCase. First
   character should be capitalized.
 * Function names should be short, lowercase and concise. Use
   underscores as word delimiter.
 * Public methods use the same naming convention as with functions. They should
   avoid having an initial underscore.
 * Private methods should have ONE initial underscore, followed by only
   lower case characters. Words should be delimited by underscore.
 * Never use two initial underscores (activates Python's name mangling scheme
   and makes debugging difficult).
 * Every module/file must at least contain a docstring describing the
   purpose of the module. All public variables, functions and classes
   should be documentated. Preferably according to PEP 257[2].
 * All Python files must use UTF-8 encoding and include
 
     # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    
   in their header.
 * All runnable Python files must include
 
     #!/usr/bin/env python
    
   in their header to make them executable on UNIX/Linux and Mac.
 * Constants should be UPPERCASE and use underscores (_).
 * Try to adhere to earlier coding convention as close as possible.
