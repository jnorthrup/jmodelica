JMODELICA PYTHON INTERFACE
===================
The JModelica Python Interface (JMPI) enables you to work with compiled
models in Python. As Python is an interpreted language you can work both
interactively or using scripts.

HOW TO USE
===================
1. Add the folder containing the jmodelica package to your PYTHONPATH.
2. Import the JMPI by adding

     import jmodelica
    
   to your Python source code.

RUNNING TESTS
===================
The JMPI tests are written using PyUNIT, which is a part of the Python
Standard Library as of Python 2.1.

Some of the tests are run on certain example models that can be found in
the JMI examples directory that comes bundled with the JModelica source
distribution. To run the the unit tests those models _needs to be
compiled_. This is done by invoking

  make examples
  
from the source distribution root.

Tests are simply run by choosing the *test.py file and running it by
invoking Python. For example

  python jmitest.py
  
. The results are printed to stderr.

RUNNING TESTS - FAQ
===================
If the test fails and outputs something similar to

  JMIException: libipopt.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such
  file or directory
  
you are missing the Ipopt shared library in your library path. This can
be solved in two ways:

 1) By installing Ipopt on your system (so that library ends up in
    /usr/local/lib or similar). See Ipopt documentation for this.
    
 2) By setting an environment variable in your shell by invoking
 
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/ipopt_build/lib
      
    Unless you put this in your shell's resource file (for example
    ~/.bashrc) you will need to run this command every time you open up
    a new shell.
