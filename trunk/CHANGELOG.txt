================= Stable-2017-08-24 ==================
; Changed ; Minor ; Compiler ; #5214
The temporary directory is always deleted, regardless of whether compilation fails or succeeds.

; Changed ; Minor ; Compiler ; #5430

Fixed generation of VendorAnnotation tag in FMI XML file to correctly handle FMI 2.0.

; Other ; Minor ; Compiler ; #5417 #5420
Improved compiler performance in general. In some cases up to -10% compilation time and -20% memory peak when compiling

; Fixed ; Minor ; Runtime ; #5421
Improved performance in the sparse linear solver (about 30%).

; Fixed ; Minor ; Compiler ; #5408
