Added the compiler flags -msse2 -mfpmath=sse for runtime builds using GCC,
the same are used for our FMUs.

gave wrong values of those parameters reported from the FMU.

; Change ; Major ; Tests ; #5489
Divided the test tags stddist, windows and casadi into stddist_base,
stddist_full, windows_base, windows_full, casadi_base and casadi_full.

are now tagged as stddist_base/full.
