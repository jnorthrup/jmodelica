Installation instructions for the JModelica Runtime system.

1. Check out the JModelica Runtime module:

    svn co https://www.jmodelica.org/svn/JModelica/trunk/Runtime

   Make sure that the full path to the directory where you check out
   Runtime does not contain any spaces.

2. Download CppAD from http://www.coin-or.org/CppAD. Unzip the 
   tar-ball and put in a directory. Again, make sure that the path to
   this directory does not contain any spaces. You do not have to build
   anything in the CppAD distribution in order to build Runtime.

3. Download Ipopt from https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt. Unzip the
   tar-ball and put in a directory that does not hold any spaces in its
   absolute path. Build the package according to its INSTALL file.

4. Run the configure script. It is recommended that you create a new
   directory in Runtime:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../configure --with-cppad=/path/to/cppad-dist \
      --with-ipopt=/path/to/ipopt-build-dir

   You may want to give additional arguments to configure, type

    configure --help

   for information. By default, the installation directory (--prefix)
   is set to the current directory.

5. Build Runtime. In order to build the Runtime, type

    make

   In order to install Runtime, type

    make install

   which will render the directories 'lib' and 'include' to be created
   and the corresponding libraries and directories and header files
   will be copied.

   In order to build the examples, type
 
    make examples

   which will build executables and shared libraries for the examples
   in the 'example' directory.
