<p>
This package contains components to model <b>1-dimensional rotational
mechanical</b> systems, including different types of gearboxes,
shafts with inertia, external torques, spring/damper elements,
frictional elements, backlash, elements to measure angle, angular velocity,
angular acceleration and the cut-torque of a flange. In sublibrary
<b>Examples</b> several examples are present to demonstrate the usage of
the elements. Just open the corresponding example model and simulate
the model according to the provided description.
</p>
<p>
A unique feature of this library is the <b>component-oriented</b>
modeling of <b>Coulomb friction</b> elements, such as friction in bearings,
clutches, brakes, and gear efficiency. Even (dynamically) coupled
friction elements, e.g., as in automatic gearboxes, can be handeled
<b>without</b> introducing stiffness which leads to fast simulations.
The underlying theory is new and is based on the solution of mixed
continuous/discrete systems of equations, i.e., equations where the
<b>unknowns</b> are of type <b>Real</b>, <b>Integer</b> or <b>Boolean</b>.
Provided appropriate numerical algorithms for the solution of such types of
systems are available in the simulation tool, the simulation of
(dynamically) coupled friction elements of this library is
<b>efficient</b> and <b>reliable</b>.
</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../Images/Rotational/drive1.png" ALT="drive1"></p>
<p>
A simple example of the usage of this library is given in the
figure above. This drive consists of a shaft with inertia J1=0.2 which
is connected via an ideal gearbox with gear ratio=5 to a second shaft
with inertia J2=5. The left shaft is driven via an external,
sinusoidal torque.
The <b>filled</b> and <b>non-filled grey squares</b> at the left and
right side of a component represent <b>mechanical flanges</b>.
Drawing a line between such squares means that the corresponding
flanges are <b>rigidly attached</b> to each other.
By convention in this library, the connector characterized as a
<b>filled</b> grey square is called <b>flange_a</b> and placed at the
left side of the component in the "design view" and the connector
characterized as a <b>non-filled</b> grey square is called <b>flange_b</b>
and placed at the right side of the component in the "design view".
The two connectors are completely <b>identical</b>, with the only
exception that the graphical layout is a little bit different in order
to distinguish them for easier access of the connector variables.
For example, <tt>J1.flange_a.tau</tt> is the cut-torque in the connector
<tt>flange_a</tt> of component <tt>J1</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The components of this
library can be <b>connected</b> together in an <b>arbitrary</b> way. E.g., it is
possible to connect two springs or two shafts with inertia directly
together, see figure below.

A flange is described by the connector class
Interfaces.<b>Flange_a</b>
or Interfaces.<b>Flange_b</b>. As already noted, the two connector
classes are completely identical. There is only a difference in the icons,
in order to easier identify a flange variable in a diagram.
Both connector classes contain the following variables:
</p>
<pre>
   Modelica.SIunits.Angle       phi  "Absolute rotation angle of flange";
   <b>flow</b> Modelica.SIunits.Torque tau  "Cut-torque in the flange";
</pre>
<p>
If needed, the angular velocity <tt>w</tt> and the
angular acceleration <tt>a</tt> of a flange connector can be
determined by differentiation of the flange angle <tt>phi</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
     w = <b>der</b>(phi);    a = <b>der</b>(w);

<p>The following figure shows examples of components equipped with
a support flange (framed flange in the lower center), which can be used
to fix components on the ground or on other rotating elements or to combine
them with force elements. Via Boolean parameter <b>useSupport</b>, the
support torque is enabled or disabled. If it is enabled, it must be connected.
If it is disabled, it must not be connected.
Enabled support flanges offer, e.g., the possibility to model gearboxes mounted on
the ground via spring-damper-systems (cf. example
<A HREF="Modelica_Mechanics_Rotational_Examples.html#Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Examples.ElasticBearing"
>ElasticBearing</a>).
</p>

<p><IMG SRC="../Images/Rotational/bearing.png" ALT="bearing"></p>

<p>
Depending on the setting of <b>useSupport</b>, the icon of the corresponding
component is changing, to either show the support flange or a ground mounting.
For example, the two implementations in the following figure give
identical results.</p>

<p>
The variables of a component of this library can be accessed in the
usual way. However, since most of these variables are basically elements
of <b>vectors</b>, i.e., have a direction, the question arises how the
signs of variables shall be interpreted. The basic idea is explained
at hand of the following figure:
</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../Images/Rotational/drive2.png" ALT="drive2"></p>
<p>
In the figure, three identical drive trains are shown. The only
difference is that the gear of the middle drive train and the
gear as well as the right inertia of the lower drive train
are horizontally flipped with regards to the upper drive train.
The signs of variables are now interpreted in the following way:
Due to the 1-dimensional nature of the model, all components are
basically connected together along one line (more complicated
cases are discussed below). First, one has to define
a <b>positive</b> direction of this line, called <b>axis of rotation</b>.
In the top part of the figure this is characterized by an arrow
defined as <tt>axis of rotation</tt>. The simple rule is now:
If a variable of a component is positive and can be interpreted as
the element of a vector (e.g. torque or angular velocity vector), the
corresponding vector is directed into the positive direction
of the axis of rotation. In the following figure, the right-most
inertias of the figure above are displayed with the positive
vector direction displayed according to this rule:
</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../Images/Rotational/drive3.png" ALT="drive3"></p>
<p>
The cut-torques <tt>J2.flange_a.tau, J4.flange_a.tau, J6.flange_b.tau</tt>
of the right inertias are all identical and are directed into the
direction of rotation if the values are positive. Similiarily,
the angular velocities <tt>J2.w, J4.w, J6.w</tt> of the right inertias
are all identical and are also directed into the
direction of rotation if the values are positive. Some special
cases are shown in the next figure:
</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../Images/Rotational/drive4.png" ALT="drive4"></p>
<p>
In the upper part of the figure, two variants of the connection of an
external torque and an inertia are shown. In both cases, a positive
signal input into the torque component accelerates the inertias
<tt>inertia1, inertia2</tt> into the positive axis of rotation,
i.e., the angular accelerations <tt>inertia1.a, inertia2.a</tt>
are positive and are directed along the "axis of rotation" arrow.
In the lower part of the figure the connection of inertias with
a planetary gear is shown. Note, that the three flanges of the
planetary gearbox are located along the axis of rotation and that
the axis direction determines the positive rotation along these
flanges. As a result, the positive rotation for <tt>inertia4, inertia6</tt>
is as indicated with the additional grey arrows.

In this section some hints are given to define your own
1-dimensional rotational components which are compatible with the
elements of this package.
It is convenient to define a new
component by inheritance from one of the following base classes,
which are defined in sublibrary Interfaces:

                    to use relative angles between drive train components
                    as states, especially, if the angle is not limited (e.g., as for drive trains

<p>
The difference between these base classes are the auxiliary
variables defined in the model and the relations between
the flange variables already defined in the base class.
For example, in model <b>PartialCompliant</b> there is no 
support flange, whereas in model 
<b>PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2</b>
there is a support flange.
</p>
<p>
The equations of a mechanical component are vector equations, i.e.,
they need to be expressed in a common coordinate system.
Therefore, for a component a <b>local axis of rotation</b> has to be
defined. All vector quantities, such as cut-torques or angular
velocities have to be expressed according to this definition.
Examples for such a definition are given in the following figure
for an inertia component and a planetary gearbox:
</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../Images/Rotational/driveAxis.png" ALT="driveAxis"></p>
<p>
As can be seen, all vectors are directed into the direction
of the rotation axis. The angles in the flanges are defined
correspondingly. For example, the angle <tt>sun.phi</tt> in the
flange of the sun wheel of the planetary gearbox is positive,
if rotated in mathematical positive direction (= counter clock
wise) along the axis of rotation.
</p>
<p>
On first view, one may assume that the selected local
coordinate system has an influence on the usage of the
component. But this is not the case, as shown in the next figure:
</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../Images/Rotational/inertias.png" ALT="inertias"></p>
<p>
In the figure the <b>local</b> axes of rotation of the components
are shown. The connection of two inertias in the left and in the
right part of the figure are completely equivalent, i.e., the right
part is just a different drawing of the left part. This is due to the
fact, that by a connection, the two local coordinate systems are
made identical and the (automatically) generated connection equations
(= angles are identical, cut-torques sum-up to zero) are also
expressed in this common coordinate system. Therefore, even if in
the left figure it seems to be that the angular velocity vector of
<tt>J2</tt> goes from right to left, in reality it goes from
left to right as shown in the right part of the figure, where the
local coordinate systems are drawn such that they are aligned.
Note, that the simple rule stated in section 4 (Sign conventions)
also determines that
the angular velocity of <tt>J2</tt> in the left part of the
figure is directed from left to right.
</p>
<p>
To summarize, the local coordinate system selected for a component
is just necessary, in order that the equations of this component
are expressed correctly. The selection of the coordinate system
is arbitrary and has no influence on the usage of the component.
Especially, the actual direction of, e.g., a cut-torque is most
easily determined by the rule of section 4. A more strict determination
by aligning coordinate systems and then using the vector direction
of the local coordinate systems, often requires a re-drawing of the
diagram and is therefore less convenient to use.

<p>
This library is designed in a fully object oriented way in order that
components can be connected together in every meaningful combination
(e.g. direct connection of two springs or two inertias).
As a consequence, most models lead to a system of
differential-algebraic equations of <b>index 3</b> (= constraint
equations have to be differentiated twice in order to arrive at
a state space representation) and the Modelica translator or
the simulator has to cope with this system representation.
According to our present knowledge, this requires that the
Modelica translator is able to symbolically differentiate equations
(otherwise it is e.g. not possible to provide consistent initial
conditions; even if consistent initial conditions are present, most
numerical DAE integrators can cope at most with index 2 DAEs).
</p>
</p>
The elements of this library can be connected together in an
arbitrary way. However, difficulties may occur, if the elements which can <b>lock</b> the
<b>relative motion</b> between two flanges are connected <b>rigidly</b>
together such that essentially the <b>same relative motion</b> can be locked.
The reason is
that the cut-torque in the locked phase is not uniquely defined if the
elements are locked at the same time instant (i.e., there does not exist a
unique solution) and some simulation systems may not be
able to handle this situation, since this leads to a singularity during
simulation. Currently, this type of problem can occur with the
Coulomb friction elements <b>BearingFriction, Clutch, Brake, LossyGear</b> when
the elements become stuck:
</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../Images/Rotational/driveConnections3.png" ALT="driveConnections3"></p>
<p>
In the figure above two typical situations are shown: In the upper part of
the figure, the series connection of rigidly attached BearingFriction and
Clutch components are shown. This does not hurt, because the BearingFriction
element can lock the relative motion between the element and the housing,
whereas the clutch element can lock the relative motion between the two
connected flanges. Contrary, the drive train in the lower part of the figure
may give rise to simulation problems, because the BearingFriction element
and the Brake element can lock the relative motion between a flange and
the housing and these flanges are rigidly connected together, i.e.,
essentially the same relative motion can be locked. These difficulties
may be solved by either introducing a compliance between these flanges
or by combining the BearingFriction and Brake element into
one component and resolving the ambiguity of the frictional torque in the
stuck mode. A tool may handle this situation also <b>automatically</b>,
by picking one solution of the infinitely many, e.g., the one where
the difference to the value of the previous time instant is as small
as possible.
