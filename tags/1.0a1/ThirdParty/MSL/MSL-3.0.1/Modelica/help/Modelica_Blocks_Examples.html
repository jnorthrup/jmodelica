<H3>Information</H3>
<PRE></pre>

<p>
This is a simple drive train controlled by a PID controller:
</p>

<ul>
<li> The two blocks "kinematic_PTP" and "integrator" are used to generate
     the reference speed (= constant acceleration phase, constant speed phase,
     constant deceleration phase until inertia is at rest). To check
     whether the system starts in steady state, the reference speed is
     zero until time = 0.5 s and then follows the sketched trajectory.</li>

<li> The block "PI" is an instance of "Blocks.Continuous.LimPID" which is
     a PID controller where several practical important aspects, such as
     anti-windup-compensation has been added. In this case, the control block
     is used as PI controller.</li>

<li> The output of the controller is a torque that drives a motor inertia
     "inertia1". Via a compliant spring/damper component, the load
     inertia "inertia2" is attached. A constant external torque of 10 Nm
     is acting on the load inertia.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The PI controller settings included "limitAtInit=false", in order that
the controller output limits of 12 Nm are removed from the initialization
problem.
</p>

<p>
The PI controller is initialized in steady state (initType=SteadyState)
and the drive shall also be initialized in steady state.
However, it is not possible to initialize "inertia1" in SteadyState, because
"der(inertia1.phi)=inertia1.w=0" is an input to the PI controller that
defines that the derivative of the integrator state is zero (= the same
condition that was already defined by option SteadyState of the PI controller).
Furthermore, one initial condition is missing, because the absolute position
of inertia1 or inertia2 is not defined. The solution shown in this examples is
to initialize the angle and the angular acceleration of "inertia1".
</p>

<p>
In the following figure, results of a typical simulation are shown:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Blocks/PID_controller.png"><br>
<img src="../Images/Blocks/PID_controller2.png">
</p>

<p>
In the upper figure the reference speed (= integrator.y) and
the actual speed (= inertia1.w) are shown. As can be seen,
the system initializes in steady state, since no transients
are present. The inertia follows the reference speed quite good
until the end of the constant speed phase. Then there is a deviation.
In the lower figure the reason can be seen: The output of the
controller (PI.y) is in its limits. The anti-windup compensation
works reasonably, since the input to the limiter (PI.limiter.u)
is forced back to its limit after a transient phase.

<p>
This example demonstrates how to construct an inverse model in Modelica
(for more details see <a href="http://www.modelica.org/events/Conference2005/online_proceedings/Session3/Session3c3.pdf">Looye, Th&uuml;mmel, Kurze, Otter, Bals: Nonlinear Inverse Models for Control</a>).
</p>

<p>
For a linear, single input, single output system
</p>

<pre>
   y = n(s)/d(s) * u   // plant model
</pre>

<p>
the inverse model is derived by simply exchanging the numerator and
the denominator polynomial:
</p>

<pre>
   u = d(s)/n(s) * y   // inverse plant model
</pre>

<p>
If the denominator polynomial d(s) has a higher degree as the
numerator polynomial n(s) (which is usually the case for plant models),
then the inverse model is no longer proper, i.e., it is not causal.
To avoid this, an approximate inverse model is constructed by adding
a sufficient number of poles to the denominator of the inverse model.
This can be interpreted as filtering the desired output signal y:
</p>

<pre>
   u = d(s)/(n(s)*f(s)) * y  // inverse plant model with filtered y
</pre>

<p>
With Modelica it is in principal possible to construct inverse models not only
for linear but also for non-linear models and in particular for every
Modelica model. The basic construction mechanism is explained at hand
of this example:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/Blocks/InverseModelSchematic.png">
</p>

<p>
Here the first order block "firstOrder1" shall be inverted. This is performed
by connecting its inputs and outputs with an instance of block
Modelica.Blocks.Math.<b>InverseBlockConstraints</b>. By this connection,
the inputs and outputs are exchanged. The goal is to compute the input of the
"firstOrder1" block so that its output follows a given sine signal.
For this, the sine signal "sin" is first filtered with a "CriticalDamping"
filter of order 1 and then the output of this filter is connected to the output
of the "firstOrder1" block (via the InverseBlockConstraints block, since
2 outputs cannot be connected directly together in a block diagram).
</p>

<p>
In order to check the inversion, the computed input of "firstOrder1" is used
as input in an identical block "firstOrder2". The output of "firstOrder2" should
be the given "sine" function. The difference is constructed with the "feedback"
block. Since the "sine" function is filtered, one cannot expect that this difference
is zero. The higher the cut-off frequency of the filter, the closer is the
agreement. A typical simulation result is shown in the next figure:

<H3>Information</H3>
<PRE></pre>
<p><b>Signal bus concept</b></p>
<p>
In technical systems, such as vehicles, robots or satellites, many signals
are exchanged between components. In a simulation system, these signals
are  usually modelled by signal connections of input/output blocks.
Unfortunately, the signal connection structure may become very complicated,
especially for hierarchical models.
</p>

<p>
The same is also true for real technical systems. To reduce complexity
and get higher flexibility, many technical systems use data buses to
exchange data between components. For the same reasons, it is often better
to use a "signal bus" concept also in a Modelica model. This is demonstrated
at hand of this model (Modelica.Blocks.Examples.BusUsage):
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="../Images/Blocks/BusUsage.png">
</p>

<ul>
<li> Connector instance "controlBus" is a hierarchical connector that is
     used to exchange signals between different components. It is
     defined as "expandable connector" in order that <b>no</b> central definition
     of the connector is needed but is automatically constructed by the
     signals connected to it (see also Modelica specification 2.2.1).</li>
<li> Input/output signals can be directly connected to the "controlBus".</li>
<li> A component, such as "part", can be directly connected to the "controlBus",
     provided it has also a bus connector, or the "part" connector is a
     sub-connector contained in the "controlBus". </li>
</ul>

<p>
The control and sub-control bus icons are provided within Modelica.Icons.
In <A HREF="Modelica_Blocks_Examples_BusUsage_Utilities_Interfaces.html#Modelica.Blocks.Examples.BusUsage_Utilities.Interfaces"
>Modelica.Blocks.Examples.BusUsage_Utilities.Interfaces</a>
the buses for this example are defined. Both the "ControlBus" and the "SubControlBus" are
<b>expandable</b> connectors that do not define any variable. For example,
<A HREF="Modelica_Blocks_Examples_BusUsage_Utilities_Interfaces.html#Modelica.Blocks.Examples.BusUsage_Utilities.Interfaces.ControlBus"
>Interfaces.ControlBus</a>
is defined as:
</p>
<pre>  <b>expandable connector</b> ControlBus
      <b>extends</b> Modelica.Icons.ControlBus;
      <b>annotation</b> (Icon(Rectangle(extent=[-20, 2; 22, -2],
                       style(rgbcolor={255,204,51}, thickness=0.5))));
  <b>end</b> ControlBus;
</pre>
<p>
Note, the "annotation" in the connector is important since the color
and thickness of a connector line are taken from the first
line element in the icon annotation of a connector class. Above, a small rectangle in the
color of the bus is defined (and therefore this rectangle is not
visible). As a result, when connecting from an instance of this
connector to another connector instance, the connecting line has
the color of the "ControlBus" with double width (due to "thickness=0.5").
</p>

<p>
An <b>expandable</b> connector is a connector where the content of the connector
is constructed by the variables connected to instances of this connector.
For example, if "sine.y" is connected to the "controlBus", the following
menu pops-up in Dymola:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="../Images/Blocks/BusUsage2.png">
</p>

<p>
The "Add variable/New name" field allows the user to define the name of the signal on
the "controlBus". When typing "realSignal1" as "New name", a connection of the form:
</p>

<pre>     <b>connect</b>(sine.y, controlBus.realSignal1)
</pre>

<p>
is generated and the "controlBus" contains the new signal "realSignal1". Modelica tools
may give more support in order to list potential signals for a connection.
For example, in Dymola all variables are listed in the menu that are contained in
connectors which are derived by inheritance from "controlBus". Therefore, in
<A HREF="Modelica_Blocks_Examples_BusUsage_Utilities_Interfaces_InternalConnectors.html#Modelica.Blocks.Examples.BusUsage_Utilities.Interfaces.InternalConnectors"
>BusUsage_Utilities.Interfaces.InternalConnectors</a>
the expected implementation of the "ControlBus" and of the "SubControlBus" are given.
For example "Internal.ControlBus" is defined as:
</p>

<pre>  <b>expandable connector</b> StandardControlBus
    <b>extends</b> BusUsage_Utilities.Interfaces.ControlBus;

    <b>import</b> SI = Modelica.SIunits;
    SI.AngularVelocity    realSignal1   "First Real signal";
    SI.Velocity           realSignal2   "Second Real signal";
    Integer               integerSignal "Integer signal";
    Boolean               booleanSignal "Boolean signal";
    StandardSubControlBus subControlBus "Combined signal";
  <b>end</b> StandardControlBus;
</pre>

<p>
Consequently, when connecting now from "sine.y" to "controlBus", the menu
looks differently:
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../Images/Blocks/BusUsage3.png">
</p>
<p>
Note, even if the signals from "Internal.StandardControlBus" are listed, these are
just potential signals. The user might still add different signal names.
